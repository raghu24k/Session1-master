<!-- 
    Nature of JavaScript
        JavaScript is multi-paradigm — it supports:
            Procedural programming
            Functional programming
            Object-Oriented programming
        
        It is prototype-based, not class-based in its core (though ES6 introduced class syntax for convenience).
